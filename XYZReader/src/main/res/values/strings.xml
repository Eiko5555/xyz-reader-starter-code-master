    <string name="article_empty">Android provides different text colors
        attributes that can be set in your custom theme and will be used
        with the text appearances the framework already provides. The value
        of a textColor can either be a simple color, or a selector (e.g. for
        disabled states). Generally secondary and tertiary colors are the
        same RGB value as the primary color but with a different opacity
        (e.g. 87% and 54%).</string>
